 as seen in the picture you delete the code.

 you will then need create a new method named play game as public.

 you will then need to write scenemanger. which you write down Loadsceneasync()

 if you dont have a scene you will need to make one.
 the way to make a scene you go to file and new scene then you will name it level 1.
